# Vestlus

_Vestlus is a conversational app._ It uses Twilio's Conversations API SDK client library along with Twilio's Paste framework to demonstrate how you might build a conversation app. Conversations consists of participants and messages, so after logging you'll see a list of conversations on the left. Once a conversation is selected participants will be at the top and messages below.

Users are stored in a JSON file. Logging in as a user with automatically create a Conversations API user, which will then make it possible to add that user as a participant in another chat.
